Fist Data_221 Assignment(Question_9): Here is a short summary for every question

Question_1: Controlled multiplication loop:
used a while loop to multiply integers 1,2,3 and so on until it exceeded a certain threshold. by incrementing  the current_number by one  and multiplying it with the product, i was able to keep track of the current multiplier.



Question_2: Nested dictionary from strings: I had to iterate through a list of strings. for each string i had to create a sub dictionary storing its length and parity(to determine the parity(even or odd) i used the length of the string and checked if it was divisible by 2)

Question_3: Safe function Application: This Question required me to argument unpack(Which meant passing elements of an iterable(list, tuple or dictionary) this was achieved using the * and ** operators)

Question_4: Sorted search with conditions: I sorted a list of random floats using .sort() while also using the enumerate function to match the indices.


Question_5: Circle area comparison with validation: I had to create a function that checks if radii are positive integers and using math.pi to calculate the area of both circles. Using the max and min function to check which of the radii had the larger or smaller area, i could then calculate the percentage of the larger circle that could be covered by the smaller circle.

Question_6: Distribution analysis: For each unique number in a list i had to calculate what percentage of the total list is less than or equal to it then returned a sorted dictionary of the percentiles.

Question_7: Time conversion function: had to use floor division (//) and modulo (%) to extract hours, minutes and seconds to determine AM or PM based on the 24_hour count.

Question_8: I learnt how to load data into a pd.DataFrame. I also learned how to use vectorized operations such as ( df["D"] = df["A"] + df["B"]) to create a computed column
